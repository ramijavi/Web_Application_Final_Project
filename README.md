Web Application Programming (CIS 371) Final Project. Authors: Joseph Seder, Jacob Mccloughan & Javier Ram√≠rez

For this project our team will use all the skills and knowledge of web application programming acquired throughout the semester to implement a survey application that uses the BlackBoard API, where users can create and answer questions. The data created from this surveys will be stored in a SQL database and will be displayed in a user-friendly way. 

These are the minium requirements for this project:

- Use Blackboard REST API in some way
- The data should be stored in MySQL tables.
- A unique CSS stylesheet must be designed and implemented. 
- Use a combination of server-side (PHP) and client-side (JavaScript) scripting

- You must make some use of AJAX
- Websites must be responsive - that is they need to adjust to the device
